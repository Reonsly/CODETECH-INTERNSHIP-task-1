OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

The password strength assessment tool is designed to evaluate the robustness of user-generated passwords by analyzing factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness. The project involves implementing algorithms to assess these metrics and providing feedback to users to encourage the creation of strong and secure passwords.

The first step in developing the tool is defining the metrics for password strength. Three primary metrics are identified: length, complexity, and uniqueness. Length refers to the number of characters in the password, with longer passwords generally considered stronger. Complexity assesses the diversity of character types used in the password, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Uniqueness evaluates whether the password is distinct and not easily guessable or commonly used.

Next, algorithms are implemented to analyze these metrics. For length assessment, the tool checks if the password meets a minimum length threshold. Complexity is evaluated by verifying if the password contains a mix of different character types, such as uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Uniqueness is determined by comparing the password against a list of commonly used passwords or dictionary words.

Once the metrics are analyzed, the tool provides feedback to users based on the assessment results. If the password fails to meet the criteria for strength in any of the metrics, appropriate feedback messages are generated to inform the user. For example, if the password is too short, the user is advised to choose a longer one. If the complexity requirements are not met, the user is encouraged to include a mix of character types. Additionally, if the password is found to be common or easily guessable, the user is warned to choose a more unique password.

The tool's functionality is demonstrated through a Python implementation, which prompts users to enter a password and then evaluates its strength based on the defined metrics. Users receive feedback on their password's strength, allowing them to make informed decisions to enhance the security of their accounts.

In summary, the password strength assessment tool aims to promote the creation of strong and secure passwords by providing users with feedback on length, complexity, and uniqueness, thereby enhancing overall cybersecurity.
